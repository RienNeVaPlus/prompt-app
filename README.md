# 👩‍💻 prompt-app

Provides an interface for node apps. Comes with built-in services for managing jobs ("cronjobs") and encrypting sensitive environment data.

It's basically [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) thrown at your service classes.

*Note: This is the result of a hackaton.*

## Install

```
npm install prompt-app // or
yarn add prompt-app
```

## Structure

See [example](./example) for details and run `yarn example`.

#### index.ts

```ts
import App from 'prompt-app'
import * as services from './services'

App({services});
```

#### services/*

```ts
export class Server {
	static description = 'Node.js Web Server';
	static color = 'red';

	/**
	 * Jobs are executed every job.interval and only if job.executable return true
	 * Rather than providing them as an object, they can be arrays as well:
	 * [Server.$flushCache, 30, (...) => ..., 'Description'] is equal to:
	 */
	static jobs: promptApp.Job[] = [{
		$: Server.$flushCache,
		interval: 30,
		executable: ({between}) => between(8, 22, true),
		description: 'Weekdays from 8 to 22'
	}];

	/**
	 * Receives the decrypted credentials (.env)
	 */
	static onCredentials(_credentials: any){
		// new Server(credentials);
	}

	/**
	 * Exposed Method
	 *
	 * By default, all methods starting with an upper-case character or with a dollar sign are exposed
	 * Use config.exposeMethod: (name) => boolean to change this
	 * The method name is mapped using config.mapMethodName ($flushCache => Flush Cache)
	 */
	static $flushCache({debug}: any){
		debug('Flushing Caches (not rly)...');
		return true;
	}
}
```

#### .env

A challenge can be created on first run.

```

Manage encrypted service credentials by using the built in "Encrypt"-Tool. Provide the encrypted strings in `APP_SERVICE-NAME_CREDENTIALS` to have them decrypted and handed over to `service.onCredentials(credentials)`.

> Warning: never provide `APP_PASSWORD` in any production environment.
